# LumenOne Pre-Alpha

| :exclamation: **LumenOne is under development**: some features may be unstable or incomplete. Its use in a production environment is strongly discouraged at this time. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |

**LumenOne** is a free and open-source alternative to Plesk, designed to simplify web hosting management (websites, domains, databases, FTP, emails, etc.) through a modern, intuitive, and lightweight interface. Developed in **Node.js**, LumenOne aims to provide a performant and extensible solution for developers and system administrators.

## :sparkles: Key Features (some feature not available now)

- :control_knobs: **Simple, responsive, and modern web interface**
- :globe_with_meridians: **Domain & subdomain management**
- :file_folder: **File management** (via SFTP/WebFTP)
- :dolphin: **Database management** (SQLite)
- :outbox_tray: **FTP account management**
- üìß **Email management** (optional)
- :whale: **Docker integration** (optional for service isolation)
- :closed_lock_with_key: **Let's Encrypt SSL certificates**
- :jigsaw: **Module/extension system** for customization
- :arrows_counterclockwise: **REST API** for automation and integration

| ‚ö†Ô∏è LumenOne currently doesn't encrypt user passwords. This will be fixed in Alpha 1.0.0 or B√™ta 1.0.0, but for now, just don't leak your "lumenone.db". |
