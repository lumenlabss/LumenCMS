# LumenCMS

| :exclamation: **LumenCMS is under development**: some features may be unstable or incomplete. Its use in a production environment is strongly discouraged at this time. |

**LumenCMS** is a free, open-source alternative to WHMCS, designed to simplify hosting management (customers, services, billing, tickets, orders, etc.) through a modern, intuitive and lightweight interface. Developed in Node.js, LumenCMS aims to offer a high-performance, scalable solution for hosting providers and system administrators.
